# LibN-N64-SDK
The simplest solution to compiling a fully working ROM with as little as possible in C or C++

After months of trying, finally got my own custom SDK to work.
What is here is nothing extraordinary, just a couple days of work. It's extremely slow at the moment and it's features are incredibly rudimentary. 

There are some snippets from LibDragon source, such as the font.h and the font drawing code, among some other code Rasky or Chillywilly may have wrote.
