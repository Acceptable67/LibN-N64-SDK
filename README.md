# LibN-N64-SDK
The simplest solution to compiling a fully working N64 ROM with as little as possible in C or C++.

What is here is nothing extraordinary, just a couple days of work and it's features are incredibly rudimentary.
It comes as a statically linked library. 

There are some snippets from LibDragon source, such as the font.h and the font drawing code, pixel line generation, entry script among some other code Rasky or Chillywilly may have wrote.
