# LibN-N64-SDK
The following project represents a minimalistic yet functional approach to compiling a fully operational Nintendo 64 ROM using C or C++, built with a modern GCC toolchain version 13.2.0. The core library provided is statically linked, ensuring simplicity and ease of integration while offering a starting point for development on the N64 platform.

Though the features here are rudimentary and represent only a few days of effort, this project serves as an accessible foundation for those looking to explore N64 development. While it does not claim to push the boundaries of complexity or performance, it provides essential functionality in a streamlined and efficient manner.

Some of the code snippets and functionality are adapted from the LibDragon project, including key components such as font.h, font rendering logic, and pixel line generation. Contributions from well-known developers within the N64 homebrew community, such as Rasky and Chillywilly, have influenced portions of the source, particularly in the initialization and entry script logic. These snippets, while adapted, are implemented with respect to their original functionality and are used to enhance the basic features of the library.

The project is designed with the intent of lowering the barrier to entry for N64 development, providing a clear path from source code to a compiled ROM. Whether you're a beginner exploring N64 homebrew or a seasoned developer looking for a lightweight solution, this project offers a reliable starting point with ample room for expansion and customization.
