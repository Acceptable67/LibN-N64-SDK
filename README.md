# LibN-N64-SDK
The simplest solution to compiling a fully working ROM with as little as possible in C or C++

After months of trying, finally got my own custom SDK to work.
What is here is nothing extraordinary, just 2 days worth of work. 

There are some snippets from LibDragon source, such as the font.h among some other code Rasky may have wrote.
